/*
 * JPML's Polyphonic Music Library
 * Developed for La Fortuna (at90usb1286) @ 8MHz
 *
 * A polyphonic synthesizer and abc player library by jpml1g14.
 *
 * Plays music from ABC notation files by generating mono PCM audio on pins OC3A (left audio channel) and OC1A (right audio channel)
 *
 * Waveform generation is done entirely on ISR1. 
 * ISR3 is used to increment the clock used for note on/off timing. 
 * ABC file parsing turned out to be too complex for an ISR, so unfortunately abc_play() blocks until the song is complete.
 *
 * Built upon the LaFortuna WAV audio library by arp1g13:
 * 	github.com/fatcookies/lafortuna-wav-lib
 * which itself was adapted from:
 * 	http://avrpcm.blogspot.co.uk/2010/11/playing-8-bit-pcm-using-any-avr.html
 *
 * Credit also to ChaN for his Fat-FS implementation:
 * 	elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html
